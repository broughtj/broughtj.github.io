## Some Thoughts on Scholarship

Lately I have been very surprised to find how narrowly some academics conceive of scholarship. Some of my thoughts
were sparked by this statement by [James M. Buchanan][jbm] (which you can find [here][cato]):

> I challenge any of you to take any issue of any economics journal and convince yourself,
> and me, that a randomly chosen paper will have a social productivity greater than zero. Most modern economists
> are simply doing what other economists are doing while living off a form of dole that will simply not stand
> critical scrutiny... I think I know what I am doing, and I think that most of those who espouse a variant of Austrian
> subjectivist economics know what they are doing. And I think that our efforts are socially productive, highly
> so.


Journal rankings become the currency of rent seeking among academics. It amazes me how unthinkingly many, otherise very intelligent and analytical people, sorry passively accept "the way things are" when it comes to the importance of journal rankings. 

We are the poorer for thinking so narrowly.
