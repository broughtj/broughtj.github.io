I have started using the [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) text editor. It's awesome! I've been
a pretty faithful [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) user for about 15 years now. But actually before
that I was an [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user. I don't remember why I originally chose Emacs. Sometime around
the year 2000 I went to a Linux install fest on a Saturday at BYU and learned
how to install Fedora on my chunky Dell laptop. I think the guy that helped me
told me to use Emacs. So I guess I did. But when I was doing my doctoral studies
my advisor used vi (not even Vim - it was vi). I installed Vim one weekend
and I have never really looked back from there. Vim has served me well. And
I don't miss the so-called [Emacs Pinky](http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_pinky.html) at all. Vim's modal editing is
simply amazing. I don't think I could write anything serious without it. 

I never really got into the [editor wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war). I remember liking Emacs and 
certainly I understood those that preferred it. But once Vim rewired by
brain, it always has felt like I didn't have much choice. And I've been
very productive in Vim for years now. 

The thing about Doom is that is it Vim emulation within Emacs. And it rocks!!!
It turns out the best text editor is neither Vim or Emacs - it's both! It's
peanut butter and chocolate. It's country and western. It's Neil Young and
Stephen Stills.

And here is Young and Stills trading some pretty killer lines:

And here is a bonus track of Neil Young's Helpless set to some 
beautiful images from my neck of the woods.

This song is all Neil Young goodness, but what would the song
be without Stills on that volume pedal?!

It's a pretty great thing in both economics and engineering when you turn
a tradeoff situation into a twofer.
