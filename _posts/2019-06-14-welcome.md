Welcome to my academic blog titled __The Man Watching__, which
is the name of one of my favorite poems written by [Rainer Maria Rilke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Maria_Rilke).

At the end of every semester I read the following poem to my students. I hope you will enjoy it,
and that it will give you a hint about my way of thinking.

> # __The Man Watching__ 
> by Rainer Maria Rilke

> I can tell by the way the trees beat, after
> so many dull days, on my worried windowpanes
> that a storm is coming,
> and I hear the far-off fields say things
> I can't bear without a friend,
> I can't love without a sister

> The storm, the shifter of shapes, drives on
> across the woods and across time,
> and the world looks as if it had no age:
> the landscape like a line in the psalm book,
> is seriousness and weight and eternity.

> What we choose to fight is so tiny!
> What fights us is so great!
> If only we would let ourselves be dominated
> as things do by some immense storm,
> we would become strong too, and not need names.

> When we win it's with small things,
> and the triumph itself makes us small.
> What is extraordinary and eternal
> does not want to be bent by us.
> I mean the Angel who appeared
> to the wrestlers of the Old Testament:
> when the wrestler's sinews
> grew long like metal strings,
> he felt them under his fingers
> like chords of deep music.

> Whoever was beaten by this Angel
> (who often simply declined the fight)
> went away proud and strengthened
> and great from that harsh hand,
> that kneaded him as if to change his shape.
> Winning does not tempt that man.
> This is how he grows: by being defeated, decisively,
> by constantly greater beings.
