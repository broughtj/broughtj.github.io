My colleague Randy Simmons and I recently wrote the attached essay on an imagined meeting between the 
economist James Buchanan and the moral philosopher Martin Buber. I'm pretty proud of this one, though
I know it will mystify my finance colleagues. 

The article is titled: [Economics As Moral Exchange: James Buchanan Meets Martin Buber](/assets/files/Brough-Simmons-Final-Draft-0702-2019.pdf)

I welcome your feedback!
