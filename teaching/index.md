In Spring 2015 I will be teaching three courses:

* Finance 6470 - Derivatives markets. This is a graduate course in derivatives markets and is part of the [MSFE](http://huntsman.usu.edu/msfe/) degree at Utah State University.
* Finance 6320 - Computational methods. This is a graduate introductory course in computational methods for financial economics. It is also part of the MFSE program.
