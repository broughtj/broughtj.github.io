## Course Description 

This course is an introduction to scientific computing in the Python programming language for modern financial economics. This is a very applied course by nature. Although there will often be class lectures that focus on theory, they will always be followed by computational exercises that focus on implementation. The computational tools that we refer to consist of two dimensions: 1) the mathematical tools that form *numerical analysis* that are helpful in solving problems in finance, and 2) the actual implementation of said tools in a programming language. The programming language that we will focus on is Python, which has become a de facto standard in the scientific computing community. Again, the focus will be applied, that is will be problem-solving oriented rather than theoretical. I expect that upon completion of this course you will have developed a set of real-world skills that will allow you to implement theories from modern finance in an industry setting or to assist you in carrying out research in a doctoral program.
