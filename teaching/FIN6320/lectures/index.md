## Tutorials

* I suggest the UNIX tutorial from **[software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/shell/index.html)**.

* I also suggest the following **[Interactive Vim tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/)**. It will give you the basics for what you need to know for vim. It is just in your browser (not real vim). But with it you can quickly learn some vim commands. I suggest making a cheat sheet for yourself as you walk through it. Then you can practice at the command line with the real thing.

* I also suggest that you complete the built-in Vimtutor. It is on any UNIX machine. At the command line type:

```
$ vimtutor
```

It will launch a vim tutorial (within vim). It is the master reference and will teach you all of vim in short easilty digestible lessons.

## IPython Notebooks
