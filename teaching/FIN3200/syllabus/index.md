## Grading

The grade that you will earn will be determined from your ranking in the class based on the weighted total points accumulated on class preparation and participation, a class project, as well as on exams. There is no predetermined percentage of the class that will earn an A or that will fail. If you all do excellent work you will all earn exceptional grades. The weights given to each part of the class are as follows:

### Class Preparation & Participation (20%)

This portion of your grade will be determined by your preparation for class lectures, your participation in class
discussions and the completion of homework assignments. Homework assignments will be given approximately every Thursday
and will be due a week later. I will drop your lowest assignment and replace it with the average of the others if you
hand all assignments in with full effort. Participation in class is crucial!

### Exams (40%)

This portion of your grade will be determined by your performance on the midterm and final exams. I will calculate your
grade two ways:

* The total of your two exam scores
* Drop the midterm exam and place all of the weight on the final

Your grade will be determined by which ever method gives you the highest total points.
