## Course Description 

This course is an introduction to derivative securities, the markets in which they trade, theoretical models for obtaining rational prices for them, and their applications in hedging and speculation. Derivatives are an advanced finance topic. At one time, a course in derivatives was considered a specialized elective, but is now considered mandatory in any finance major. Our topic is by nature an analytical one that will require a good deal of mathematics and quantitative reasoning. However, we will seek a balance between the theoretical presentation of the material and a practical implementation. The skill set necessary to effectively implement modern financial derivative pricing models is a crucial one to have for those seeking a job in the finance industry.
