### Huntsman School Pillars 

This course aligns with the Huntsman School Pillars along the dimension
of analytical rigor. In addition, we will be able to discuss the
financial crisis and the role that derivatives played in that saga. As
such ethical leadership will be touched upon. Financial derivatives are
perhaps the fastest growing products in any market. The entrepreneurial
spirit comes strongly into play. Finally, a global vision is required to
understand modern derivatives markets as the trading markets continue to
become more and more global.

## Textbook

* *[Derivative Markets, 3rd Edition](http://goo.gl/RRrDuv)*.

## Grading 

The grade that you earn will be determined by your ranking in the class
based on the weighted total points accumulated on class preparation and
participation, as well as on exams. There is no predetermined percentage
of the class that will get an A or that will fail. However, if you all
do excellent work you will all earn exceptional grades. The weights
given to each part of the class are as follows:

-   Class Preparation, Participation, and Homework (30%) – I expect
    each student to come prepared for each class session. Preparation
    includes completing the assigned readings, writing down questions
    for sections of the reading that were not fully understood or
    internalized, and completing homework assignments. Class
    participation is crucial for understanding. I will call on students
    in class. There are always two good answers when called upon. The
    first correct response is an informed answer based on your
    preparation. The second correct response is a question that shows
    that you have wrestled with the material in your preparations. A
    good question often lays the foundation for a more complete
    understanding. One important aspect of class participation is the
    professionalism with which you conduct yourself. I will drop your
    lowest homework assignment and replace it with the average of the
    others, BUT only if I deem it of sufficient quality and effort.

-   Midterm Exam (35%) – The midterm will be a traditional in–class
    exam. You are allowed a single sheet of notes for the exam.

-   Final Exam (35%) – The final exam will be a traditional in–class
    exam. You are allowed a single sheet of notes for the exam.
