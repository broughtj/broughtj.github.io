Welcome to my academic website. Here you will find information about my 
academic interests. For me, scholarship is comprised both of teaching
and research. I'll have much more to say about this in my future blog
posts. I should say that I've never been successful at maintaining a blog,
but maybe this time will be different. 

You can read more about me on my [Huntsman School](http://huntsman.usu.edu/directory/brough-tyler#!) website.

Again, welcome!
